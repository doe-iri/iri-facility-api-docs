The U.S. Department of Energy’s Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) is a long-term effort to let researchers 
seamlessly and securely combine DOE’s world-class experimental facilities, data resources, and advanced computing 
systems into integrated workflows that radically accelerate scientific discovery.

Within this program, the IRI Interfaces Technical Subcommittee focuses on the “front door” to that ecosystem: it 
gathers requirements, defines cross-facility use cases, and specifies unified interfaces for DOE Office of Science 
Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) facilities, going beyond low-level APIs to include higher-level front 
ends (such as Jupyter environments) and orchestration systems.

By designing and prototyping these common interfaces in collaboration with facility teams and the broader community, 
the subcommittee aims to make it much easier for scientists to build robust, portable, and performant cross-facility 
workflows on top of IRI.
