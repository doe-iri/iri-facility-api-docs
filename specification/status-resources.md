# 6.1 Resource

## Overview
A *Resource* is an entity that either directly delivers a service to an end user or application 
(e.g., a compute node, virtual machine, network endpoint, storage instance), or indirectly supports 
the delivery of such a service by enabling, hosting, or connecting other resources (e.g., authentication 
server, routers, switches, power supplies).  *Resources* are typed, managed, and monitored objects that 
represent the components making up a systemâ€™s operational fabric. They are central to service modeling, 
observability, and incident response. A *Resource* will have an associated operational state, events, 
and incidents.

## Attributes
A `resource` is defined with the following attributes:

| Attribute             | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                           | Required | Example                                                                                                                                       |

### ENUM ResourceType

The type of `resource` based on its role at the Facility.

```yaml
    ResourceType:
      type: string
      description: The type of Resource.
      enum:
        - website
        - service
        - compute
        - system
        - storage
        - network
        - unknown
      example: system
```

### ENUM StatusType

The possible status values for a `resource`.  If there is no last Event associated with the `resource` to indicate a current status, then currentStatus defaults to `unknown`.

```yaml
    StatusType:
      type: string
      description: The current status of this Resource at time of query.
      enum:
        - up
        - degraded
        - down
        - unknown
      example: up
```

## Relationships to other resources

The `resource` has a set of well-defined relationships that allows for navigation between objects based on 
relationship type.  In this model the type relationship is represented by the attribute name, and the 
target object of the relationship is represented by a URI (`*_uri`). 

The following table describes the relationships contained in `resource` and their destination object type.

| Attribute            | Source   | Relationship   | Destination  | Description                                                                        |
|:---------------------|:---------|:---------------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `self_uri`           | Resource | self           | Resource     | A Resource has a mandatory reference to itself.                                    |
| `member_of_uri`      | Resource | memberOf       | Facility     | A Resource is a member of one of more Facilities (allowing for a shared resource). |
| `located_at_uri`     | Resource | locatedAt      | Site         | A Resource is located at one Site.                                                 |

## Endpoints

The following REST endpoints provide access to Resources available under the Status model:

| Method | Path                                        | Description                                                                                   | Idempotency |
|-------:|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
|    GET | `/api/v1/status/resources`                  | Retrieve a collection of resources (paginated and filterable). Supports conditional requests. | Yes (safe)  |
|    GET | `/api/v1/status/resources/{resource_id}`    | Retrieve a single resource by ID. Supports conditional requests.                              | Yes (safe)  |

## Request & Response Semantics

### Path params
When a GET operation targets a single `resource` it can do this through use of path params.  The URL 
template `/api/v1/status/resources/{resource_id}` is used to focus the GET operation to return a 
single `resource` object identified by `{resource_id}`.

  | Name          | In   | Type          | Required | Description                 |
  | ------------- | ---- | ------------- | -------- |-----------------------------|
  | `resource_id` | path | string (UUID) | yes      | Identifier of the Resource. |

### Query params (collection)

All query parameters are optional, however, paging is automatically enforced using the `limit` and `offset`
query parameter defaults.  This will restrict any unparameterized GET operation to return the first 100
`resource` objects sorted by `id`.

| Parameter        | Description                                               | Type/Format                                                                       | Default | Required |

| `resource_type`  | Filter by resource type.                                  | enum: `website`, `service`, `compute`, `system`, `storage`, `network`, `unknown`  | - | No |
| `capability`     | Filter by capability names.                               | array of strings                                                                  | - | No |
| `current_status` | Filter by current status.                                 | array of enum: `up`, `degraded`, `down`, `unknown`                                | - | No |
| `modified_since` | Filter resources modified since timestamp (ISO 8601).               | date-time                                                                | - | No |
| `offset`         | Number of records to skip for pagination.  Defaults to 0. | integer                                                                           | `0` | No |
| `limit`          | Maximum number of records to return.  Defaults to 100.    | integer                                                                           | `100` | No |

### Security model (authN/authZ).

Endpoints are unauthenticated for the *Facility* and *Status* API.

### State transitions / invariants

  * The Facility and Status Endpoints are currently read-only (`GET` only).
  * `id` is immutable; `self_uri` is a stable dereference to this item.
  * Conditional requests MUST follow RFC 9110 semantics: **200** when modified; **304** with no body when not modified. ([RFC Editor][6])

#### Operation: _getResources(current_status)_
* GET `/api/v1/status/resources?current_status={StatusType}` (paginated)
* Returns: `resource` Collection

This operation returns a collection of `resource` filtered by the query parameter current_status.

Request:

```http
% curl -sS -H "Accept: application/json" -v -i "https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/resources?current_status=down"

GET /api/v1/status/resources?current_status=down HTTP/1.1
Host: iri.example.com
User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
Accept: application/json
```

Response **200 OK**:

#### Operation: _getResources(modified_since)_
* GET `/api/v1/status/resources?modified_since={date-time}` (paginated)
* Returns: `resource` Collection

Using `modified_since` on a `GET` makes the request conditional similar to the standard `If-Modified-Since`
header: the server only sends the full representation if it has changed since the supplied date; otherwise
it replies 304 Not Modified with no message body. The only difference is that `modified_since` specifies
the date format as ISO 8601 standard date time.  Each `resource` contains a property named `last_modified`
that is also in ISO 8601 standard date time format and mimics the standard `Last-Modified` header
functionality for that `resource`. ([RFC Editor][6])

Request:

```http
% curl -sS -H "Accept: application/json" -v -i "https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/resources/057c3750-4ba1-4b51-accf-b160be683d80?modified_since=2025-10-13T23:00:48-04:00"

GET /api/v1/status/resources/057c3750-4ba1-4b51-accf-b160be683d80?modified_since=2025-10-13T23:00:48-04:00 HTTP/1.1
Host: iri.example.com
User-Agent: curl/8.1.2

}
```

Here is a second example where a 304 status code is returned since the `resource` has not been modified 
since the query date-time.

Request:

```http
% curl -sS -H "Accept: application/json" -v -i "https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/resources/057c3750-4ba1-4b51-accf-b160be683d80?modified_since=2025-10-13T23:00:48-04:00"

GET /api/v1/status/resources/057c3750-4ba1-4b51-accf-b160be683d80?modified_since=2025-10-13T23:00:48-04:00 HTTP/1.1
Host: iri.example.com
User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
Accept: application/json
```

Response **304 Not Modified**:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 
Content-Location: https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/resources/057c3750-4ba1-4b51-accf-b160be683d80
Last-Modified: Tue, 14 Oct 2025 03:00:48 GMT
Date: Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:12:58 GMT
Server: DOE IRI Demo Server
```

No response body is sent for **304**, per RFC 9110; and similar to`If-Modified-Since` behavior specified by HTTP
semantics. ([RFC Editor][6])

### Error examples (Problem Details, RFC 9457)

All error responses use media type `application/problem+json` and fields per RFC 9457 (`type`, `title`, 
`status`, `detail`, `instance`, plus optional extensions). ([RFC Editor][8])

* **400 validation error** (invalid `resource_type`):

```json
{
  "type": "https://iri.example.com/problems/invalid-parameter",
  "title": "Invalid parameter",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "resource_type must be from defined ENUM set.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/status/resources?resource_type=car",
  "invalid_params": [
    { "name": "resource_type", "reason": "resource_type must be from defined ENUM set." }
  ]
}
```

* **401 unauthorized** (missing or bad token):

```json
{
  "type": "https://iri.example.com/problems/unauthorized",
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": "Bearer token is missing or invalid.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/status/resources"
}
```

The server also includes `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer â€¦` per RFC 6750. ([IETF Datatracker][3])

* **403 forbidden** (authenticated but lacks role):

```json
{
  "type": "https://iri.example.com/problems/forbidden",
  "title": "Forbidden",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "Caller is authenticated but lacks required role.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/status/resources"
}
```

Use 403 when authentication succeeded but authorization failed, per HTTP guidance. ([MDN Web Docs][9])

* **404 not found** (unknown `resource_id`):

```json
{
  "type": "https://iri.example.com/problems/not-found",
  "title": "Not Found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "No resource with id '2c6f4e08-4b0e-4c55-9313-4f4e0a93e111' exists.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/status/resources/2c6f4e08-4b0e-4c55-9313-4f4e0a93e111"
}
```

404 indicates the target resource is not present. ([MDN Web Docs][10])

* **409 conflict** (generic example shown for consistency across resources; not expected from `GET`):

```json
{
  "type": "https://iri.example.com/problems/conflict",
  "title": "Conflict",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "The request conflicts with the current state of the target resource.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/status/resources"
}
```

Conflict indicates a state conflict (typical for write operations), defined by HTTP semantics. ([MDN Web Docs][11])

* **500 internal server error**:

```json
{
  "type": "https://iri.example.com/problems/internal-error",
  "title": "Internal Server Error",
  "status": 500,
  "detail": "An unexpected error occurred.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/status/resources"
}
```

Represents an unexpected condition preventing the server from fulfilling the request. ([Wikipedia][12])

## OpenAPI 3.1 Snippet (YAML)

A minimal, valid OAS 3.1 description **scoped to this resource**. Uses JSON Schema 2020-12 style and examples; error
responses follow RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`. ([OpenAPI Initiative Publications][1])

    description: |-
      The Status API offers users programmatic access to information on the operational status of various resources within a facility, scheduled maintenance/outage events, and a limited historical record of these events. Designed for quick and efficient status checks of current and future (scheduled) operational status, this API allows developers to integrate facility information into applications or workflows, providing a streamlined way to programmatically access data without manual intervention.

      It should be noted that the operational status of a resource is not an indication of a commitment to provide service, only that the resource is in the described operational state.

      The Facility Status API is not intended for reporting or monitoring purposes; it does not support asynchronous logging or alerting capabilities, and should not be used to derive any type of up or downtime metrics. Instead, its primary focus is on delivering simple, on-demand access to facility resource status, and scheduled maintenance events.

## Notes & Decisions

* **Versioning rationale.** The API is versioned under `/api/v1` to allow additive, backward-compatible evolution following common REST versioning practices while keeping path stability. (OpenAPI 3.1 is used to describe the interface.) ([OpenAPI Initiative Publications][1])
* **Pagination/filtering rules.** Page-based query parameters (`offset`, `limit`) are provided so clients can traverse pages by relation rather than by constructing URLs. ([IETF Datatracker][2])
- **Filtering.** `from`/`to` filter on `occurred_at`; `modified_since` filters on `last_modified`.

## Changelog

* 2025-10-05 â€“ Initial draft.
