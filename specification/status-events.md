# 6.2 Events

## Overview
An **Event** is a discrete, timestamped occurrence that reflects a change in the state, condition, or behavior of a
**Resource**, typically within the context of an ongoing Incident.  Events provide the fine-grained details necessary 
to understand the progression and impact of an **Incident** (e.g., transitions between `up`, `degraded`, and `down`).
Events are immutable records useful for audits and timelines.

## Attributes
An `event` is defined with the following attributes:

| Attribute       | Type           | Description                                                                 | Required | Example |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `id`            | string         | Unique identifier (UUID).                                                   | yes      | `003e33cd-fa5e-43f8-8670-e4681c41559a` |
| `self_uri`      | URI            | Canonical hyperlink to this Event.                                         | yes      | `https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/events/003e33cd-fa5e-43f8-8670-e4681c41559a` |
| `name`          | string         | Long name/title of the Event.                                              | yes      | `Global Homes` |
| `description`   | string         | Human-readable description of the Event.                                   | no       | `global_homes is UP` |
| `last_modified` | date-time      | Timestamp (ISO 8601) when this Event was last modified.                    | yes      | `2025-05-24T17:04:30.000Z` |
| `status`        | StatusType     | Status at the time of the event.                                           | yes      | `up` |
| `occurred_at`   | date-time      | Timestamp (ISO 8601) when the event occurred.                              | no       | `2025-05-24T17:04:30.276Z` |
| `resource_uri`  | URI            | Hyperlink to the impacted **Resource**.                                    | yes      | `https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/resources/ff415c87-6596-41c7-93fd-b772994a92d4` |
| `incident_uri`  | URI            | Hyperlink to the generating **Incident**.                                  | yes      | `https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/incidents/82c413be-3d2b-47aa-97ff-8611a11f0182` |

### ENUM StatusType

```yaml
        StatusType:
          type: string
          description: The status of the resource associated with this event.
          enum:
          - up
          - degraded
          - down
          - unknown
          example: down
```

## Relationships to other resources
An `event` has a set of well-defined relationships that allows for navigation between objects based on
relationship type.  In this model the type relationship is represented by the attribute name, and the
target object of the relationship is represented by a URI (`*_uri`).

The following table describes the relationships contained in an `event` and their destination object type.

| Attribute      | Source | Relationship | Destination | Description                                   |
|----------------|--------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `self_uri`     | Event  | self         | Event       | An Event has a mandatory reference to itself. |
| `resource_uri` | Event  | impacts      | Resource    | An Event impacts a Resource.                  |
| `incident_uri` | Event  | generatedBy  | Incident    | An Event is generated by an Incident.         |

## Endpoints
| Method | Path                                        | Description                                                    | Idempotency |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/v1/status/events`                     | Retrieve a collection of events.                               | Yes (safe)  |
| GET    | `/api/v1/status/events/{event_id}`          | Retrieve a single event by ID.                                 | Yes (safe)  |
| GET    | `/api/v1/status/events/{event_id}/resource` | Retrieve the resource impacted by the event identified by ID.  | Yes (safe)  |
| GET    | `/api/v1/status/events/{event_id}/incident` | Retrieve incident associated with the event identified by ID.  | Yes (safe)  |

## Request & Response Semantics

### Path params

When a GET operation targets a single event it can do this through use of path params.  The URL
template `/api/v1/status/events/{event_id}` is used to focus the GET operation to return a
single `event` object identified by `{event_id}`.

| Name        | In   | Type          | Required | Description              |
|-------------| ---- | ------------- | -------- |--------------------------|
| `event_id`  | path | string (UUID) | yes      | Identifier of the Event. |

### Query params (collection)

All query parameters are optional, however, paging is automatically enforced using the `limit` and `offset`
query parameter defaults.  This will restrict any unparameterized GET operation to return the first 100
`event` objects sorted by `id`.  It should also be noted that the query parameters providing filtering 
are considered additive, such specifying `?name="HPSS Archive (User)"&status=down` would return all events
where `name` is equal to "HPSS Archive (User)" AND the `status` is "down".

| Parameter | Description                                                    | Type/Format        | Default | Required |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|:-------:|----------|
| `name` | Filter by exact event name (case-insensitive).                    | string             | -       | No |
| `status` | Filter by `StatusType`.                                         | enum: `up`, `service`, `degraded`, `down`, `unknown`| -       | No |
| `from` | Return events with `occurred_at >=` this timestamp (ISO 8601      | date-time          | -       | No |
| `to` | Return events with `occurred_at <=` this timestamp (ISO 8601).      | date-time          | -       | No |
| `modified_since` | Filter resources modified since timestamp.             | date-time           | -       | No |
| `offset` | Number of records to skip for pagination.  Defaults to 0.       | integer            | `0`     | No |
| `limit` | Maximum number of records to return.  Defaults to 100.           | integer            | `100`   | No |

### Security model (authN/authZ)

Endpoints are unauthenticated for the *Facility* and *Status* API.

### State transitions / invariants

* The Facility and Status Endpoints are currently read-only (`GET` only).
* `id` is immutable; `self_uri` is a stable dereference to this item.
* Conditional requests MUST follow RFC 9110 semantics: **200** when modified; **304** with no body when not modified. ([RFC Editor][6])

#### Operation: _getEvents(modified_since)_
* GET `/api/v1/status/events?modified_since={date-time}` (paginated)
* Returns: `event` Collection

Using `modified_since` on a `GET` makes the request conditional similar to the standard `If-Modified-Since`
header: the server only sends the full representation if it has changed since the supplied date; otherwise
it replies 304 Not Modified with no message body. The only difference is that `modified_since` specifies
the date format as ISO 8601 standard date time.  Each `event` contains a property named `last_modified`
that is also in ISO 8601 standard date time format and mimics the standard `Last-Modified` header
functionality for that `event`. ([RFC Editor][6])

Request:

```http
% curl -sS -H "Accept: application/json" -v -i "https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/events?modified_since=2025-10-17T20:18:00.000Z" 

GET /api/v1/status/events?modified_since=2025-10-17T20:18:00.000Z HTTP/1.1
Host: iri.example.com
User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
Accept: application/json
```

Response **304 Not Modified**:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 
Content-Location: https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/events
Last-Modified: Fri, 17 Oct 2025 20:18:00 GMT
Date: Fri, 17 Oct 2025 20:59:42 GMT
Server: DOE IRI Demo Server
```

No response body is sent for **304**, per RFC 9110; and similar to`If-Modified-Since` behavior specified by HTTP
semantics. ([RFC Editor][6])

-----

#### Operation: _getResourceByEvent(event_id)_
* GET `/api/v1/status/events/{event_id}/resource`
* Returns: `resource` Item

This operation returns the single `resource` item impacted by this `event`.

Request:

```http
% curl -sS -H "Accept: application/json" -v -i "https://iri.example.com/api/v1/status/events/04a89656-32e2-4b5b-9af6-4fb1efc83a63/resource"

      The Status API offers users programmatic access to information on the operational status of various resources within a facility, scheduled maintenance/outage events, and a limited historical record of these events. Designed for quick and efficient status checks of current and future (scheduled) operational status, this API allows developers to integrate facility information into applications or workflows, providing a streamlined way to programmatically access data without manual intervention.

      It should be noted that the operational status of a resource is not an indication of a commitment to provide service, only that the resource is in the described operational state.

      The Facility Status API is not intended for reporting or monitoring purposes; it does not support asynchronous logging or alerting capabilities, and should not be used to derive any type of up or downtime metrics. Instead, its primary focus is on delivering simple, on-demand access to facility resource status, and scheduled maintenance events.

## Notes & Decisions
- **Versioning.** Both endpoints are exposed under `/api/v1/...` for stability.
- **Pagination.** `offset` + `limit` paging on the sorted-by-id list per implementation.
- **Filtering.** `status` applies to the event’s status at occurrence; `from`/`to` filter on `occurred_at`; `modified_since`
  filters on `last_modified`.

## Changelog
- 2025-10-15 — Initial draft for Events based on `docs/status-resources.md` and `StatusController.java`.

## Standards Referenced
- HTTP Semantics (RFC 9110).
- Problem Details for HTTP APIs (RFC 9457).
- OpenAPI 3.1.0; JSON Schema 2020-12.
